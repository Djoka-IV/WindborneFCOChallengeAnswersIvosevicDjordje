Semantic is a game where you must guess a word based on how similar the words are semantically, with a percent similarity given. A good beginner strategy would be large, vague words that will help narrow down a possible solution. Words like “thing”, “system”, “place”, things of that nature, and narrow down the possible solutions. Narrowing down the options is based on which words score the highest and try to guess similar words or synonyms. A dictionary and a thesaurus would be great aids in the game as some words could be synonyms of the category, for instance, if the word of the day is “reserve” and I guess “bank”, it would be difficult to guess reserve without utilizing a dictionary and thesaurus in order to expend all possible options. A good way to get unstuck is to guess drastically different words to see if there is any other possible option that is being missed or simply refreshing your brain. 
I enjoy painting Warhammer miniatures. It’s a hobby that rewards patience, attention to detail, and working carefully in small increments. I like planning color schemes, testing techniques on less visible areas first, and accepting that some attempts won’t turn out perfectly on the first try. What I enjoy most is the balance between planning and adapting. Even going into it with a plan, the paint doesn’t always behave exactly how you expect, so you adjust as you go. Over time, it’s taught me to slow down, stay observant, and make steady improvements rather than rushing toward a result. 
I am interested in the 3PM – 12PM shift, I tend to be more focused and alert in the latter half of the day, and I am also a night owl by nature, so this schedule aligns well with my natural rhythm.
